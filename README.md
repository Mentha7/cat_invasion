# Cat Invasion
A shooting game created with `pygame`. Following the guidance of Eric Matthes' **Python Crash Course**.

## Background
You are a courageous precious piece of broccoli facing an army of black cats playing some musical instrument. You need to protect the rest of your kind (the other broccoli). You'll die either when you make contact with these cats or when you let any cat land.ï¼ˆYou need to shoot them all before they land. Good luck!) 

## How to play (and quit)

Run cat_invasion.py in your terminal.
```
python3 cat_invasion.py
```
- Press `Start` to play the game.
- To move around, use left/right key. 
- To shoot, use spacebar.
- Level up by eliminating all cats on screen.
The difficulty of the game increases as you level up, everything will move faster, but you also get higher scores.
- Quit anytime by pressing `q`.

Have fun playing the game and you are welcome to challenge the current high score!
